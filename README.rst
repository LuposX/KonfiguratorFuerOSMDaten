Whether it’s biking to college or driving to the supermarket, traffic
effects us all. This product uses generated geodata from the free
project ‘OpenStreetMap’ (OSM) and creates a numerical ranking of the attractiveness of geographic locations. A main focus is the
configurability of the generation of this score. 
Traffic planners can easily use this attractiveness score
for their traffic forecasting models.
